When surveying the internet for different datasets to analyze, it was interesting to come across the Chicago data portal that stored a wide variety of datasets relating to the city. The data that interested me most in this portal was the data logging taxi trips taken across the city. Each recent calendar year has a full dataset with records of the distinct taxi trips taken through the year with details such as the time and date of the trip, fare, tip paid, company used, pick up and drop off community area. I decided to explore the 2020 calendar year dataset while pairing it with income, population, and square area datasets for the different community areas sourced from other sites. The three questions I decided to explore are:

•	With 2020 as a transition year due to COVID-19, what were the general trends in taxi usage through the year?

•	On some trips a tip was paid while on many others a tip was not. What general factors in the dataset relate to whether a tip is paid?

•	With the median household income, population, and area data on the community areas in the additional datasets, how do these factors relate to the frequency of taxi trips in the different community areas?
